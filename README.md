Utilize Python 3 to get network applications up and running quickly and easily.This repository contains all the code given in the book Learning Python Network Programming(2015) by Dr. M. O. Faruque Sarker , Sam Washington
Before understanding the concept of how to implement python on network programming one must have a understanding of the network layers and the protocols associated with it.

 	Layer 	Name 	                                                                 Function
  	5 	Process & Applications 	                        Provide applications services to users and programs
  	4 	Transport 	                                    Handles data-consistency functions, i.e., provides a reliable byte stream between two nodes on a network. TCP and UDP work at this level.
  	3 	Internet (sometimes called the Network Layer) 	Provides network addressing and routing, and does so in such a way as also to provide a common address space across multiple lower-level protocols. This makes possible the interconnection of networks that characterizes the Internet. The IP protocol operates at this level.
  	2 	Network (sometimes called the Data Link Layer) 	This layer contains whatever IP will run over, e.g., Ethernet, token-ring, and Fiber Distributed Digital Interface (FDDI) networks. Individual network protocols, e.g., Ethernet, work at this level.
  	1 	Physical 	                                      Not really part of the model, since TCP and IP, as protocols, deal with software rather than hardware. This layer is generally thought of as referring to all hardware under the Network Layer.
    
    and how the gateway and router works.
